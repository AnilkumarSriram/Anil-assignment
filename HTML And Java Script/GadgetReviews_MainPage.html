			<p id="PlotPara">The carbon-fiber-constructed Pro 13 weighs only 2.34 pounds; it's 2.9 pounds with its power supply, 
			which is as much as the 13-inch MacBook Air weighs on its own. The body measures 12.7 inches wide by 8.5 inches deep, 
			which is fractionally smaller than the Air, and matches its 0.68-inch thickness.
			If you don't dive deeper than base specs, the 13-inch Air and Pro 13 Touch match each other fairly closely. 
			It's once you look at the Sony's fine details, you'll uncover differences, and in a game of specsmanship, the Sony wins. Still, 
			in the end, they're both excellent laptops and it comes down to what you like and what you want to have.
